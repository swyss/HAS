# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The Home Automation System (**HAS**) follows a modular and scalable architecture, enabling seamless integration of devices, protocols, and applications. The system comprises multiple components that communicate via APIs, messaging protocols, and data streams.

---

## High-Level Architecture
The HAS architecture is divided into the following components:

### **1. Core Backend (EchoStream)**
- **Role:** Central processing unit for business logic, APIs, and data aggregation.
- **Key Features:**
  - REST APIs for device management and data integration.
  - Time-series data storage using InfluxDB.
  - Communication with gateways and devices via MQTT and WebSockets.

### **2. Admin Console (AdminTool)**
- **Role:** Web interface for system administration and monitoring.
- **Key Features:**
  - User and device management.
  - Real-time system status monitoring.
  - Configuration management.

### **3. Visualization and Analysis (DataTrendz)**
- **Role:** Dashboards and analytics for real-time and historical data visualization.
- **Key Features:**
  - Integration with InfluxDB and Grafana.
  - Interactive charts and graphs for trend analysis.

### **4. Mobile Application (SmartControl)**
- **Role:** Cross-platform mobile application for users.
- **Key Features:**
  - Device control and monitoring.
  - Push notifications for events and anomalies.

### **5. Gateway (EdgeLink)**
- **Role:** Local gateway for collecting and forwarding device data.
- **Key Features:**
  - Protocol translation for ZigBee, Z-Wave, Philips Hue, and Google Home.
  - Data transmission to the Core Backend via MQTT.

### **6. Sensor Monitoring (SensGuard)**
- **Role:** Ensures reliability of devices and sensors.
- **Key Features:**
  - Anomaly detection for real-time and historical data.
  - Health monitoring and error diagnostics.

### **7. Data Simulation (SimulaX)**
- **Role:** Simulates data for system testing and development.
- **Key Features:**
  - Backend: ASP.NET Core for generating and managing simulations.
  - Frontend: Vue.js with Quasar for dashboards.
  - Database: PostgreSQL and InfluxDB for data storage.
  - Communication: REST APIs and WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Data Flow
1. **Devices → Gateway:**
   Sensors and actuators communicate with the gateway using supported protocols (e.g., ZigBee, Z-Wave).
2. **Gateway → Backend:**
   The gateway forwards data to the Core Backend using MQTT or REST APIs.
3. **Backend → Applications:**
   The backend provides data to the Admin Console, Visualization, and Mobile Application via RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
4. **SimulaX → Backend:**
   Simulated data is forwarded to the Core Backend for testing and analysis using REST APIs.

---

## Deployment Architecture
The system is containerized and deployed using **Docker**. The following services are deployed:
1. **Core Backend**
2. **Admin Console**
3. **Visualization Service**
4. **Gateway Service**
5. **Sensor Monitoring Service**
6. **SimulaX Service**
7. **Databases (PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Redis)**

Orchestration is managed using **Docker Compose** or Kubernetes for scalability.

## Future Enhancements
- High availability deployment using Kubernetes.
- Cloud integration for additional scalability.
- Machine learning models for advanced anomaly detection.
- Enhanced simulation scenarios in SimulaX.
