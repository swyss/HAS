# Project Overview

## Project Name: Home Automation System (HAS)

## Description
HAS is a modular platform that enables centralized control, data collection, and analysis for smart home devices and systems. It now includes SimulaX for advanced data simulation capabilities.

---

## Goals
- Integrate smart home devices using popular protocols.
- Enable centralized control via web, mobile, and analytics tools.
- Process and analyze real-time and historical sensor data.
- Provide simulated datasets for testing and development.

## Components
1. **Core Backend (EchoStream)**
2. **Admin Console (AdminTool)**
3. **Visualization and Analysis (DataTrendz)**
4. **Mobile Application (SmartControl)**
5. **Gateway (EdgeLink)**
6. **Sensor Monitoring (SensGuard)**
7. **Data Simulation (SimulaX)**

---

## Key Technologies
- **Java (Spring Boot)** for backend.
- **Vue.js + Quasar** for web applications.
- **MAUI (C#)** for mobile apps.
- **Python** for gateway communication.
- **PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Redis** for data storage.
- **ASP.NET Core** for SimulaX backend.
